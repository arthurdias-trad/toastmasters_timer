# Toastmasters Timer

A simple timer application to be used in timing Toastmasters speeches, whether they are prepared speeches, TableTopics or evalutations.

By setting the minimum and maximum time, the app will signal green (minimum allowable time reached), yellow and red (maximum allowable time), providing for additional 30 seconds before the speaker is disqualified and cannot be voted as best speaker or evaluator.

It is a single page application made using HTML and vanilla JS.
